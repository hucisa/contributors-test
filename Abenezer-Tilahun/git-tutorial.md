I was familiar with most of the topics in "the basics" part.
I've gained a lot of stuff from the intermidate part though including stuff about :
    -Undoing changes(never used it before)
    -stashing
    -tagging
    -advanced branching(i only knew about creating new branch and changing to it)
and so on... these are the one's currently coming into mind for now..
