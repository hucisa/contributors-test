#basic of version control with Git:
 ->Basic Command
    .clone
    .pull
    .commit
    .push
    .branch
    .merge
    .add 

I learnt on git about:
  - git.clone to clone remote repo to locally work with.
  - git.add to add all files or specific file to cloned or initialized git. 
  - git.commit to commit changes and save it with specific id and message using -m "message..."
  - pushing what on local to remote after change and some step using git.push

#collaboration
-using Git, different devlopers can work on same project without overriding each other's work.Pull request or merge request enable peer review,critical for open-source development
-when work with git,every change that gets made is logged with a commit and each commit carries with it a commit message and the author's detail and help to know who has made change and if want to have clarification onthat accessing individual by using his email directly.
